# Healing and Recovery

## Resting

Despite their heroism, adventurers cannot engage in exploration, social interaction, and combat every hour of the day. They require rest periods to sleep, eat, tend to their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and prepare themselves for further adventures. Adventurers have the option to take short rests during the day and a long rest at the end of the day.

### Short Rest

During a short rest, which must be at least one hour long, a character engages in non-strenuous activities such as eating, drinking, reading, tending to their wounds, and keeping watch. It is a period of downtime where they can do nothing more physically demanding than those activities.

A character gains the following benfits from a short rest:

* regain Health based on TOU check (TX), if any.

* regain Fatigue based on a ST + PHY check (TZ), if any.

* regain Stress based on a WP + AW check (TY), if any.

* regain Doubt based on a CO + FEL check (TN), if any.

### Long Rest

A long rest is an extended period of downtime that lasts at least 8 hours. During this time, a character can either sleep or engage in light activities such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for up to 2 hours. However, if the rest is disrupted by at least 1 hour of strenuous activity, such as walking, fighting, or casting spells, the characters must start the rest again to receive any benefits from it.

A character gains the following benfits from a long rest:

* regain Health based on TOU or PHY whichever is higher.

* regain all Fatigue.

* regain Stress based on DET.

* regain Doubt based on TRA.

In some cases, characters may need to be hospitalized or placed in a medical facility for more intensive treatment and observation.
