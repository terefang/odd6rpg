# General Rules

The system uses die codes to represent a character's proficiency in certain areas, the effectiveness of
weapons, and the usefulness of equipment. These codes, represented by a number of six-sided dice, are 
used in rolling to determine success or failure in actions and mechanics within the game. The higher 
the die code, the better skilled or equipped the character is in that area. The core mechanics of the 
game revolves around these rolls.

## Time

Time flows differently from the real world, akin to the narrative pacing of a book or movie.

The gamemaster (GM) wields total control over time to shape the tempo. In this dynamic, there are six fundamental units of game time that ensure a coherent storytelling experience for everyone involved:

* **Round (or Combat Turn) —** The shortest time increment, a combat turn spans roughly six seconds. It reflects the duration it takes for a character to execute usually a single action.

* **Scene (or Encounter) —** A scene constitutes a standard time unit that encapsulates a single event occurring in a specific location. The GM holds the prerogative to fast-forward through portions of a scene, but typically, a new scene commences with a change of location or the initiation of a distinct event.

* **Game Session —** A game session extends from the moment players convene to the time they wrap up their gaming activities. Ideally, by the conclusion of a game session, players should feel a sense of accomplishment and yet yearn for more.

* **Story —** A story represents a comprehensive tale that may span several game sessions or can unfold within a single session.

* **Downtime —** Less pivotal events can be glossed over during gameplay, a practice known as downtime. Often, this occurs between game sessions, providing characters with an opportunity for off-screen growth and development.

* **Campaign —** A campaign weaves together a series of stories, united by a common thread, be it characters, themes, or overarching plotlines. As the game unfolds, both GM and players collaborate to interlace these storylines into an epic saga, creating a rich tapestry of interconnected narratives.

## Actions

Actions can be quick, time-consuming, or instantaneous. They also vary based on whether there's opposition. Here are the main types:

* **Standard Actions —** These are quick and simple tasks, like swinging a sword or casting a spell. Success depends on your skills.

* **Extended Actions —** Some tasks take time, like deciphering a book or repairing armor. You roll dice multiple times, and success depends on accumulating enough milestones over time.

* **Opposed Actions —** When characters compete or try to stop each other, like grabbing a weapon, they make opposed rolls. The one with the higher result wins.

* **Reflexive Actions —** These happen instantly, like grabbing something to avoid falling. Success depends on your passive attributes. If it's opposed, the one with the higher result wins.

## Dice Rolls

Skill rolls are determined by rolling a set of dice that includes a combination of attribute and skill dice. The number of dice in the pool depends on the attribute and skill ratings of the character, and the roll is modified by any relevant bonuses or penalties. The total of the roll will determine the success or failure of the action.

A dice pool is expressed as a combination of dice codes and pips. The dice code indicates the number of six-sided dice that are rolled when attempting an action, such as 1d, 2d, 3d, 4d, 5d, etc. Pips, represented by "+1" or "+2," are added to the total result of the dice roll.

### Difficulty Levels

Difficulty levels are used to determine the degree of difficulty of a task or action that a character attempts. The GM will determine the difficulty level of a task based on a variety of factors, such as the character's skill level, the complexity of the task, and any external factors that may affect the task.

There are generally a few different levels of difficulty used:

* **Automatic —** Effortless action, never fails on a green field.

* **Trivial —** Almost anyone should be able to do this most of the time.

* **Easy —** Most characters should be able to do this most of the time, with a low risk of failure, such as simple physical tasks, basic mathematical calculations, or other routine activities.

* **Moderate —** Tasks that require some skill or effort, but are still relatively straightforward, such as basic repair work, climbing a short wall, or simple lock-picking.

* **Difficult —** Tasks that are challenging and require a significant level of skill, effort, or experience to accomplish, such as complex repairs, open complex locks, or persuading a hostile adversary.

* **Hard —** Tasks that are extremely challenging and require a high level of skill, effort, or experience to accomplish, such as defusing a bomb, escaping from a maximum-security prison, or performing a complex surgery.

* **Heroic —** Tasks that are almost impossible to accomplish without extraordinary skill, effort, or experience, such as lifting a car, defying gravity, or performing a dangerous stunt.

* **Epic —** Tasks that are nearly impossible to accomplish, without incredible luck or aid of the powers that are.

| Epic        | 12    | 7     | 35    |  28   |  21   |   18  |

*   **D/P** — Dice Difficulty or average Penalty Dice to be applied.
*   **DC/SL** — Difficulty Class or Success Level.
*   **TN** — Main Target Number for checks.
*   **TX,TY,TZ** — Auxilliary Target Numbers.

### Expert Skill Rolls

Expert skills have a special rule called "exploding dice" which allows a player to roll again and add it to the previous roll if they roll the maximum value on the die. This can be repeated as long as maximum value is rolled.

### Target Number, Bonus and Penalty Dice

In many situations, characters face factors that can affect their tasks. These factors result in either bonuses or penalties to their actions. Bonuses add extra dice to their rolls, while penalties are dice that subtract from the result.

To determine the final result of a roll, the following steps are taken:

* If there is a target number (TN), subtract it from the roll result to obtain the final result.

* If there are penalty dice, roll them and subtract the sum from the roll result to obtain the final result.

### Success Level

The success level is calculated by comparing the final result of the roll against the appropriate column of the difficulty table.

### Critical Success

A roll of three sixes is used to indicate a critical success. When a roll results in three sixes, it usually means that the character has performed the action exceptionally well and will have a greater chance of success or gain a bonus.

A critical success can grant many benefits, such as extra damage on an attack, more favorable outcome on a skill check, or bonus on the next roll. It's at the discretion of the GM to decide what exactly the critical success will grant.

### Taking the Average (ie. Defaulting)

Characters have the option to "default" on a dice roll if they have enough dice in their pool to automatically meet or exceed the target number (reference "TN" vs "D" columns) without rolling.

To be able to default on a roll, a character's dice pool must have at least the same number of dice as the TN and the penalty dice must be subtracted from the pool before defaulting can be considered. If a roll is made at disadvantage, defaulting is not possible, the character needs to roll the dice.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Certain abilities or situations may grant you an advantage or disadvantage on a roll. Multiple levels of advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out until only advantage, disadvantage or none remain. When this occurs, note any "1" or "6" result on a dice. 
If you have advantage, your success level increases for every such die. 
Conversely, if you have disadvantage, your success level decreases for every such die.
This needs to be checked even for failed/successful rolls as this increase/decrease can make a roll to succeed/fail instead.

>   **Example 1 —**
>   Nobody is attempting an action with a dice pool of 6, and the target number (TN) is 22. 
>   Nobody has the Advantage in this situation.
>   Nobody rolls the dice and gets results of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, totaling 21. 
>   Normally, this would be considered a failed roll.
>   However, due to Nobody's Advantage, they gains two additional success levels,
>   one extra success level for rolling both a "1" and a "6."
>   
>   *The final outcome is an Epic Result, actually a successful roll with one Success Level.*

>   **Example 2 —**
>   Somebody is attempting an action with a dice pool of 6, and the target number (TN) is 15. 
>   Somebody has the Disadvantage in this situation.
>   Somebody rolls the dice and gets results of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, totaling 21. 
>   Normally, this would be considered a successful roll with one success level.
>   However, due to Somebody's Disadvantage, he looses two success levels,
>   one level for rolling both a "1" and a "6."
>   
>   *The final outcome is an Easy Result, actually a failed roll with one Failure Level.*

### Retry Attempt

When your character fails a task, there might be a chance to make another attempt, depending on the situation and the GM's discretion. However, if your character wants to try the same action again after failing, they will face a penalty of -2d.

Not all tasks can be retried. Generally, tasks that can be retried are those where failing once doesn't result in immediate consequences. 
Extended actions, which involve multiple dice rolls for the same task, also don't count as retries.
