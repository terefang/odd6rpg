# Characters

Player characters are the characters that are created and controlled by the players, 
These characters will have abilities, skills, and other attributes that can be customized 
by the players and these characters are meant to be used to interact with the game world 
and NPCs (non-playable characters) to complete missions, overcome challenges and drive 
the story forward.

Player characters can come from different backgrounds, races, classes, and alignments,

their characters' actions, so they need to make decisions that align with the character's 
personality and motivations. The player's task is to bring to life the character and make 
it interact with the world.

## Traits

### Attributes

Player characters (PCs) have a set of attributes that represent the characters' physical,

* Agility (AGL) – Represents the character's physical agility, speed and dexterity, used for determining success in actions that rely on quick movements and coordination, like dodging, sneaking, and balancing.

* Toughness (TOU) – Represents the character's physical stamina, used for determining how much damage a character can take before falling unconscious, and how much effort a character can put into a physical task before becoming exhausted.

### Passive Attributes

There are attributes that are considered passive, meaning they are not actively used to perform actions or make rolls, 
but they reflect the character's general level of ability in that area. These attributes can be used by the GM as a 
reference point to determine how a character might react or behave in certain situations, rather than requiring a roll.

* Reaction (RE = AGL ÷ 2) – Representing a character's reflexes and readiness in sudden events.

* Stamina (ST = TOU ÷ 2) – Representing a character's ability to endure and recuperate from physical efforts and injuries.

direct impact on the character's ability to perform certain actions or make certain rolls.
