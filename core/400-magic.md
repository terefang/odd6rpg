## Power Sources

A magical power source refers to the fundamental energy or essence from which magical abilities and spells are derived and is the underlying force that enables individuals to tap into supernatural powers and manipulate reality in ways that go beyond the natural laws of the world.

### The Arcane

Arcane magic draws its power from the fundamental forces and energies that permeate the world. It is often associated with knowledge, mysticism, and intellectual prowess. Arcane spellcasters study ancient tomes and practice intricate rituals to harness this power, allowing them to manipulate reality, cast spells, and create magical effects.

*The Arcane is most strongest in the Astral Realm.*

### The Divine

Divine magic is derived from the power of deities or divine entities. It is connected to faith, spirituality, and the forces of good and evil. Divine spellcasters, such as clerics or paladins, channel this magic through their devotion, prayers, and divine connection. They often use their powers to heal, protect, or smite their enemies in the service of their chosen deity.

*The Divine is most strongest on Holy/Consecrated Grounds and Celestial Realms.*

### The Primal

Primal magic draws its strength from the natural world and the raw forces of creation. It is closely tied to the elements, wilderness, and the spirits of nature. Druids and shamans are examples of primal spellcasters who tap into this magic. They can manipulate the elements, commune with animals, and shape-shift, harnessing the primal forces to bring about both destructive and nurturing effects.

*The Primal is most strongest in the Feywyld Realm.*

### The Verse

Verse magic is a unique and esoteric power source that originates from the spoken word, rhythm, and language. It is a form of magical expression where incantations, poetry, or songs and cords as well as word of power are used to cast spells and shape reality. Skilled prctitioners use their voices and melodies to weave powerful enchantments, inspire others, or manipulate emotions.

### The Runic

Runic magic is based on ancient symbols, glyphs as well as circles and pentagrams that hold inherent power. These magical symbols are often inscribed, drawn or etched on objects or cast into the environment to create specific effects. Runic magic is associated with craftsmanship, knowledge of ancient languages, and rune mastery. Runes can be used to enhance weapons, protect against malevolent forces, or unlock hidden knowledge.

### The Elemental

Elemental magic is derived from the forces of the elemental planes, which represent the fundamental building blocks of existence: earth, air, fire, and water. Elemental spellcasters have the ability to manipulate and control these elemental forces. They can summon creatures, conjure storms, manipulate matter, or create devastating attacks using the powers of the elements.

*The Elemental is most strongest in the corresponding Elemental Realms.*

### The Shadow

Shadow magic draws its power from the realm of darkness, secrets, and shadows. It is often associated with stealth, illusion, and manipulation. Shadow magic users can tap into the unseen world and manipulate shadows, create illusions, or drain life force. They are skilled at hiding in plain sight and casting spells that deceive or hinder their foes.

*The Shadow is most strongest in the Shadowfell and Infernal Realm.*

## Traditions

### Sorcery

Sorcery is a magical tradition that focuses on harnessing and manipulating raw magical energies. Sorcerers possess an innate connection to magic, allowing them to cast spells and manipulate mystical forces without relying heavily on formal training or extensive study. Their power comes from within, often fueled by their own life force or personal essence. Sorcery emphasizes intuition, instinct, and personal willpower, enabling sorcerers to shape and direct magical energy with relative ease.

### Wizardry

Wizardry is a magical tradition rooted in extensive knowledge and study of arcane arts. Wizards devote themselves to the mastery of intricate spells, ancient tomes, and the understanding of magical theory. They often employ complex rituals and incantations to wield magic effectively. Wizards tend to possess a vast array of spells at their disposal and excel in academic pursuits related to magic. They often acquire their magical powers through rigorous education, apprenticeships, and the pursuit of arcane secrets.

### Artificing

Artificing is a magical tradition centered around the creation and manipulation of permanent magical artifacts and enchanted objects. Artificers are skilled craftsmen who infuse mundane items with magical properties. They combine their knowledge of arcane theory, alchemy, and craftsmanship to imbue objects with specific magical effects. Artificers often spend years honing their skills and experimenting with different materials and enchanting techniques. Their creations can range from magical weapons and protective amulets to enchanted tools and intricate mechanisms.

### Enchanting

Enchanting is a magical tradition that focuses on imbuing objects with temporal magical properties and enhancing their inherent qualities. Enchanters can infuse items with spells, protective wards, or other mystical enhancements. They often possess a deep understanding of magical energies, symbolism, and the principles of object resonance. Enchanting requires the use of magical ingredients, rituals, and the mastery of intricate enchantment techniques. Enchanted items can possess extraordinary properties, such as granting enhanced abilities, providing protection, or holding magical reservoirs for future use.

### Theurgy

Theurgy is a magical tradition that involves the practice of divine or celestial magic with a focus on establishing a connection with higher beings, such as deities or celestial entities, to channel divine energy and perform miraculous feats. They often engage in rituals, prayers, or acts of devotion to gain favor or guidance from these entities. Theurgy is closely tied to faith, spirituality, and religious beliefs. Theurgists can heal the wounded, banish dark forces, and invoke blessings upon themselves or others through their connection with the divine.

### Druidry

Druidry is a magical tradition deeply rooted in nature and the balance of the natural world. Druids draw their power from the primal forces of the earth, such as plants, animals, and the elements. They possess a profound connection with the natural world and often act as its protectors and guardians. Druids commune with spirits, tap into ley lines, and conduct rituals to maintain harmony and preserve the delicate ecosystems. They possess the ability to shape-shift, communicate with animals, and manipulate the forces of nature. Druidic magic emphasizes harmony, wisdom, and attunement to the cycles of life.

### Elementalism

Elementalism is a magical tradition centered around the mastery of the elemental (and to a lesser degree) primal forces. Elementalists focus on manipulating and harnessing these energies to shape the world around them. They can summon and control beings, command the elements themselves, and create devastating attacks. Elementalists often have a deep understanding of the natural balance of the elements and their interactions, allowing them to bring harmony or chaos depending on their intentions.

*   Hydromancy (Water)
*   Pyromancy (Fire)

### Necromancy

Necromancy is a dark and often forbidden magical tradition associated with death, spirits, and the manipulation of life force. Necromancers have the ability to communicate with and control the spirits of the deceased. They can raise the dead, extract knowledge from spectral entities, and wield curses or dark magic. Necromancy is often viewed with fear and mistrust due to its association with the macabre and the potential for corrupting the natural cycle of life and death.

### Shamanism

Shamanism is a magical tradition deeply connected to the spiritual realm and the guidance of ancestral spirits. Shamans act as intermediaries between the mortal world and the spirit world, communing with spirits for healing, divination, and guidance. They often possess the ability to enter trance states or journey to the spirit realm. Shamanic magic is characterized by rituals, dances, and the use of totems or sacred objects. Shamans can heal ailments, divine the future, and call upon the power of the spirits to influence the physical world.

### Adeptry

Adeptry (aka Reflexive magic) operates on the belief that the human psyche and instanct can directly shape reality. It eliminates the need for external tools by allowing to craft and transform reality using the body as a tool. Practitioners project a part of themselves into an object, causing a change. It focuses on training the body to extend its capabilities, utilizing existing characteristics and abilities according to their will, bridging the gap between the mind and the physical world.

## Magic Actions

### Attack/Damage

*   Base Difficulty: *as per Range*
*   Damage: +3TN per 1d
*   Area: +1TN per space, +2TN per hole space
*   Duration: Instant, +3TN per Round (see below)

Just make a normal attack roll using your magic pool instead as per normal combat rules, the targets can opt using their normal Defense or Counterspell.

*Area Effect —* Area-effect magic can also manifest as devastating phenomena like windstorms or fiery explosions. These spells inflict damage comparable to a regular spell of the same power. Area-effect spells follow the mechanics of Blast attacks (refer to the combat rules).

*Duration/Burning —* Attack spells can be designed to have a lingering effect, inflicting damage over multiple rounds akin to the prolonged effects of poison or an unrelenting flame burning a foe. When the Duration is employed in this manner, the spellcaster casts and initiates the attack with the spell just once. If the spell successfully hits the target, it proceeds to deal damage for a number of rounds equal to the duration specified. Any damage that is not mitigated by protective measures continues to affect the target until the spell's duration expires.

*Holy/Unholy (Divine) —* When attacking a target that opposes the character's faith or deity, damage is doubled. (+5TN)

### Barrier/Shield

*   Base Difficulty: tbd.
*   Power: +3TN per 1d/Magnitude
*   Target: self or touch
*   Duration: 1 round, +1TN per Round, +10TN for scene/encounter

The effect encompass a range of abilities, including auras, barriers, and wards. 

*Aura —*  Auras provide a protective energy that envelops an individual or item. The appearance of a Shield aura is distinct and recognizable. By default, auras are visible to normal senses unless an Illusion effect is employed to conceal them. Auras allow for the passage of air and light, enabling the caster to breathe and see. However, they do not provide protection against blinding lights or harmful gases. It's important to note that only one protective aura can be active at a time. If a second aura is cast on the same target, only the aura with the greater level of protection will remain in effect.

Under the protection of an Aura, the target becomes immune to the special effects of critical hits during combat as it creates an impenetrable barrier, preventing attacks from bypassing its defenses and targeting vulnerable spots effectively being rendered ineffective. However, non-damaging attacks such as grapples, disarms, and other maneuvers still have their usual impact if successfully executed.

*   *Light Filter/Protection —* +5TN
*   *Toxic Gas Filter/Protection —* +10TN
*   *Full Environmental Enclosure —* +20TN, protected target wil suffocate unless alternate breathing source is provided.

*Barriers —* Barriers form a stationary shield of energy, shaped according to the caster's preference. The appearance of the barrier is unique, allowing them to manifest walls of ice, shields of arcane force, or swirling columns of wind, among other possibilities. Barriers remain stationary and cannot be moved once created. However, the spell caster can freely pass through the barrier, and they have the option to allow others to pass through as well.

*Wards —* Wards provide specific protection against certain threats or (non-damage) conditions, elemental effects, skills, diseases, magical modes, or specific creatures. Each ward offers a bonus to the defense of affecting the protected individual. Multiple wards of the same type cannot be used simultaneously, but different types of wards can be used together.

*Reverse: Curse —* Curses are the malicious counterparts of Wards, intended to make a being or item more vulnerable to harm. They are cast in the same manner as Wards but have the opposite effect. Instead of protection, Curses make the target more susceptible, from the specified threat or malady and non-damaging Curses impose penalties.

### Beguiling

*   Base Difficulty: Easy
*   Power: +3TN per 1d/Magnitude
*   Range/Area: 1 target, +1TN per additional target
*   Duration: 1 round, +1TN per Round, +10TN for scene/encounter

Beguiling magic controls thoughts and emotions. The practitioner can give a single command to the subject, such as "Halt," "Sleep," or "Tell me your name." The command is transmitted mentally and doesn't need to be spoken aloud. The subject will try their best to follow the instruction until the magic's duration ends.

*Subjects cannot be ordered to do something against their nature or abilities. For example, they can't be commanded to fly.*

Dangerous actions like attacking an enemy can be commanded, but extremely harmful or suicidal actions receive penalties (at the GM's discretion).

*Changing Mental/Social —* Effects provide a bonus of +1d per magnitude on related mental/social rolls.

### Conjuration/Manifestation

*   Base Difficulty: *per Range*
*   Power: +3TN per 1d/Magnitude
*   Duration: 1 round, +1TN per Round, +10TN for scene/encounter

Effects draw upon the pimordial essence to create non-living materials and objects. The practitioner needs familiarity with the desired object or material, although basic shapes require no special knowledge.
Creating exact replicas or intricate pieces may incur a penalty, and the spellcaster might need the appropriate craft skill, as determined by the GM.
When the Magic's duration ends, the manifested item disappears, unless it has been consumed or mixed with another substance. Manifested water can still quench thirst even after the Magic fades, and manifested metals mixed with others will remain alloyed after the spell's expiration.

*Mass —* Base weight 10kg, +1TN per 10kg.

*Complexity*

*   Simple objects — (knives, cups) +2TN
*   Complex objects — (furniture, door and frame) +5TN
*   Simple device — (a water clock) +10TN
*   Complex device — (a working automaton, a gear-driven timepiece, an automated Antikythera mechanism) +15TN
*   Mundane materials — (rock, water, air, etc.) +0TN
*   Dangerous material — (poison, acid) +10TN
*   Precious materials — (gold, silver, emeralds) +10TN
*   Magical materials — (Orichalcum, Quicksilver) +15TN

*Reverse / Dematerialize —* An effect can make objects temporarily disappear. This allows them to create openings in walls or cause an opponent's weapon to vanish from their grip. However, it's important to note that this effect cannot be used on living matter.

### Deception/Obfuscation

*   Base Difficulty: Easy
*   Power: +3TN per 1d/Magnitude
*   Features: +3TN per Sense/Feature/Detail
*   Range/Area: 1 space, +3TN per range/size increment
*   Duration: 1 round, +1TN per Round, +10TN for scene/encounter

this action enables the creation and detection of artificial sensory stimuli, including phantasmal images and illusory sounds. These illusions appear real but lack substance. A standard magnitude-1 effect can be perceived through a single sense, such as sight, without incorporating touch, smell, taste, or hearing. However, it does not possess motion capabilities.

*Base Magnitude —* The effect can reach the volume of a shout, the brightness of a torch, or the size of a humanoid.

*Sensory Enhancement —* Effects can be augmented by incorporating other sensory elements like sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell. These sensory enhancements are convincing but lack tangible substance.

*Motion —* Visual effects can be imbued with movement. The caster must be within the range of the effect and have the ability to sense it in order to control its motion. Alternatively, an effect can be tethered to an object or being, allowing it to move alongside the target. For instance, someone could wear an illusory cloak that appears to flutter in the wind.

*Details —* The base effect possesses a certain level of detail, but this enhancement takes it to another level. The effect can now exhibit a heightened level of vivid detail, allowing for the reproduction of intricate maps, the enhancement of perceived value and quality of an item, or the flawless replication of someone's facial features.

*Invisibility —* Using Deception, a target can become invisible. It requires mimicking the environment accurately. Stationary invisibility is 2 magnitudes. Moving invisibly adds 2 magnitudes. Each magnitude conceals two more people or a large creature.

*Making Light —* Effects can create light. A stationary light globe is 1 magnitude. Adding 1 magnitude allows it to move with the magician. Blinding enemies requires a ranged attack roll, with a penalty for targeting the eyes. TBD.

*Phantasmal Visage —*  Effects provide a bonus of +1d per magnitude on related skill rolls.

### Kinetic

*   Base Difficulty: *per Range*
*   Power: +3TN per 1d/Magnitude/
*   Duration: 1 round, +1TN per Round, +10TN for scene/encounter

Magic that moves and manipulates objects and beings without physical contact. Full concentration is required to maintain levitation or manipulation. Other powers cannot be used simultaneously. Line of sight is necessary to initiate the effect. Magnitude 1 allows control of up to 50kg within range.

*Holding and Lifting —* The rating of a Kinetic effect is divided between holding and lifting the target. When lifting multiple objects, the total weight is considered. If an object falls out of range, it falls normally.

*Distant Manipulations —* Manipulations at a distance, such as pulling levers or slamming doors, follow the same rating rules. Skills or Attributes determine success or failure.

*Grappling Attack —* Using the effect, one can grapple an opponent from a distance. The magnitude acts as the value for breaking the grapple. While grappled, the target is immobile and choking an opponent requires successful grappling first.

### Manipulate/Enchantment

*   Base Difficulty: *see below*
*   Power: *see below*
*   Target: self or touch
*   Duration: 1 round, +1TN per Round, +10TN for scene/encounter

The effect is used to modify the physical forms of objects and beings. The difficulty needed depends on the extent of the changes desired by the Magician. Minor cosmetic alterations can be achieved with low-level Magic, while higher-level effects can completely transform a form or change one creature into another. Manipulate is focused on physical alterations, and deals with modifying Attributes, abilities, and Skills in the following ways:

*Minor Manipulation (TN 5) —* Allows for the alteration of facial features in living beings or the form of small objects (up to the size of a small child). It also enables changing the scale of a living being by one level.

*Significant Manipulation (Level 10) —* Enables the transformation of one humanoid into another humanoid species. It can also produce unnatural alterations such as feathers or grass instead of hair. Additionally, it allows for changing the form and material of objects, as long as they are no larger than an average adult human.

*Major Manipulation (Level 15) —* Enables the transformation of one species into any other species. It can also convert a 5m x 5m section of any non-living object into a different substance, such as stone to metal, metal to wood, or soil to water.

*Complete Alteration (Level 20) —* Allows for the complete alteration of any living being in any imaginable way, such as transforming flesh into stone. It also grants the ability to change a 20m volume of any non-living material into any other substance, including living substances. This is the only means of magically creating life, barring divine intervention.

*Increased/Decreased Skill Rating —* +3TN per +1d/Magnitude

*Increased/Decreased Attribute —* +10TN per +1d/Magnitude

*Alter Protection/Damage Rating —* +3TN per +1d/Magnitude

*   When beings are transformed into other species through manipulation, their Attributes and usable Skills remain unchanged unless the effect explicitly changes their scores.
*   If the subject had sustained injuries prior to the transformation, those injuries will persist afterward.
*   As a countermagic, Effects can restore objects or beings that have been affected back to their original forms.

### Healing

*   Base Difficulty: *see below*
*   Power: +3TN per 1d/Magnitude
*   Target: self or touch, +2TN per additional target

The effect repairs physical damage and heals injuries/illnesses on living creatures.

### Hyperaestesia

*   Base Difficulty: *per Range*
*   Power: +3TN per 1d/Magnitude
*   Target: self or touch
*   Duration: 1 round, +1TN per Round, +10TN for scene/encounter

The effect is employed to augment their own or others' abilities to perceive. It extends beyond the realms of sight, hearing, smell, and touch, encompassing the capacity to alternate forms of vision, enhance empathy and discern emotions or truthfulness in others. 

*Alternate Forms of Sense —* The effect allows to eliminate penalties or heighten sensory input. +3TN per 1d/Magnitude.

*Locate Object/Person —* The effect allows to uncover the whereabouts of specific individuals, items, or creatures. +3TN per bonus dice.

*Scrying —* Effect is clairvoyance, enabling to peer into distant locations through magical vision. However, only the five basic senses can be employed while using clairvoyance. +1TN per Kilometer.

*Reverse: Obscure —*  The reverse is to Obscure, which conceals objects, beings, and locations from both magical and mundane detection. It's important to note that effects do not render objects completely invisible, but rather make them go unnoticed. +3TN per 1d penatly dice.

### Summoning

*   Base Difficulty: *as per Size and Power*
*   Power: +3TN per 1d/Magnitude
*   Duration: 5 rounds, +5TN for scene/encounter, +10TN for day, +15TN for week, +20TN for month, +30TN for year

The effect enables spellcasters to bring powerful otherworldly beings, such as demons and spirits, to their location. It is a risky and unpredictable, particularly at higher power levels. The caster selects the type of creature to summon, within the limitations of their Order, and the spell's level determines the corresponding creature's level of power.

Successful Summoning spells bring the intended entity, bound by the spell's power, unable to harm the caster. They can answer up to three questions or perform a specified service. The summoned being's knowledge and capabilities determine the usefulness of their answers. When no corresponding statistics exist, the GM assigns game mechanics based on similar creatures.

*Servitude —* Summoned creatures serve the summoner for the spell's duration and then return to their realm. They can be imprisoned in enchanted items or vanish if not restrained.

*Battle of Wills —* Success binds creature to servitude, Partial Success allows resistance, Failure grants freedom, and Critical Failure may result in attack based on creature's disposition.

*Reverse: Banishment —* Effect of returning summoned creatures to their plane of existence. Banishment has a penalty equal to the creature's ability level. A caster can attempt Banishment on unsummonable entities with a +5TN penalty on the casting roll.
