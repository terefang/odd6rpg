# Characters

Player characters are the characters that are created and controlled by the players, 
These characters will have abilities, skills, and other attributes that can be customized 
by the players and these characters are meant to be used to interact with the game world 
and NPCs (non-playable characters) to complete missions, overcome challenges and drive 
the story forward.
