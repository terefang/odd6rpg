# Characters

Player characters are the characters that are created and controlled by the players, 
These characters will have abilities, skills, and other attributes that can be customized 
by the players and these characters are meant to be used to interact with the game world 
and NPCs (non-playable characters) to complete missions, overcome challenges and drive 
the story forward.

Player characters can come from different backgrounds, races, classes, and alignments, 
this will reflect their personality, motivations, and goals. Players are responsible for 
their characters' actions, so they need to make decisions that align with the character's 
personality and motivations. The player's task is to bring to life the character and make 
it interact with the world.

## Traits

### Attributes

Player characters (PCs) have a set of attributes that represent the characters' physical 
and mental abilities. These attributes are determined by the player and GM during character 
creation and can be increased or decreased through the course of the game.

The specific attributes use the following attributes as standard:

* Physique (PHY) – Represents the character's physical strength and power, used for determining damage dealt with melee weapons and physical tasks that rely on brute strength.

* Agility (AGL) – Represents the character's physical agility, speed and dexterity, used for determining success in actions that rely on quick movements and coordination, like dodging, sneaking, and balancing.

* Toughness (TOU) – Represents the character's physical stamina, used for determining how much damage a character can take before falling unconscious, and how much effort a character can put into a physical task before becoming exhausted.

* Intelligence (INT) – Represents the character's mental sharpness and learning ability, used for determining success in tasks that require knowledge, memory, or problem-solving.

* Awareness (AWA) – Represents a character's perception and ability to notice things in their environment with all their available senses.

* Determination (DET) – Represents the character's mental strength and determination, used for determining success in tasks that require mental fortitude, such as resisting manipulation or maintaining focus.

* Influence (INF) – Represents a character's ability to sway or control the actions of others, through persuasion, negotiation, or manipulation. It is used to determine success in actions that involve convincing NPCs to provide information, perform a task, or change their behavior.

* Fellowship (FEL) – Represents a character's ability to connect with and understand others, both NPCs and PCs alike. It is used to determine success in social interactions, such as negotiation, persuasion, or networking. It can also be used to determine how other characters react to the character.

* Tranquility (TRA) – Represents a character's ability to remain calm and composed under pressure, it can be used to determine success in actions that require focus and self-control, such as meditation, resisting fear or maintaining a disguise.

### Passive Attributes

There are attributes that are considered passive, meaning they are not actively used to perform actions or make rolls, 
but they reflect the character's general level of ability in that area. These attributes can be used by the GM as a 
reference point to determine how a character might react or behave in certain situations, rather than requiring a roll.

* Reaction (RE = AGL ÷ 2) – Representing a character's reflexes and readiness in sudden events.

* Stamina (ST = TOU ÷ 2) – Representing a character's ability to endure and recuperate from physical efforts and injuries.

* Alertness (AL = AWA ÷ 2) – Reflecting the character's ability to stay aware and vigilant of their surroundings. (aka Passive Perception)

* Willpower (WP = DET ÷ 2) – Reflecting the character's strength of mind, to resist outside influence or maintain focus.

* Empathy (EM = FEL ÷ 2) – Reflecting a character's skill in understanding and relating to the feelings and point of view of others.

* Composure (CO = TRA ÷ 2) – Reflecting a character's self-control, level-headedness and ability to remain calm under pressure.

When calculating Passive Attributes always round up.

### Levels/Thresholds Tracks

Player characters (PCs) have resources that represent the character's physical and mental well-being. 
These resources can be affected by the character's actions and the events of the game, and can have a 
direct impact on the character's ability to perform certain actions or make certain rolls.

* Health – Represents a character's physical well-being and ability to withstand damage. 
Characters who take damage will have their health reduced, and if their health reaches zero, 
they become unconscious.

* Fatigue – Represents a character's physical exhaustion and ability to perform strenuous tasks. 
Characters who become fatigued may suffer penalties to their rolls and become less effective in combat.

* Stress – Represents a character's mental well-being and ability to handle stressful situations. 
Characters who suffer from high levels of stress may suffer penalties to their rolls and become 
less effective in social interactions or problem-solving tasks.

* Doubt – Represents a character's ability to trust and rely on their own abilities. Characters who 
suffer from doubt may suffer penalties to their rolls and become less effective in decision making.

### Secondary Attributes

Secondary attributes are additional attributes that are used to represent a character's active physical or 
mechanical abilities. These attributes may not be as central to a character's concept or role, but still are 
important for gameplay and determining success in certain actions.

* Size (SIZ) – Represents a character's physical size, which can affect things like their reach in combat and their ability to fit into small spaces.

* Move (MOV = PHY + AGL) – Represents a character's speed and mobility, it can be used to determine how far a character can move in a round of combat or how quickly they can cover distance in the game world.

* Perception (PER = RE + AL) – Represents a character's ability to perceive their environment and any potential threats or opportunities, in a more general sense than the awareness attribute, it can affect a character's ability to spot hidden objects or notice subtle changes in their environment. (aka Conflict Perception)

* Initiative (INI = RE + AWA) – Represents a character's ability to react quickly and make the first move in combat, It can be used to determine the order of turns in combat and who goes first.

* Defense (DEF = PER ÷ 2) – Represents a character's ability to evade or block incoming attacks, it can be used to determine how well a character can dodge, block or parry a blow in combat

When calculating Defense always round down.
