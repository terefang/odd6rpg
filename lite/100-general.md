# General Rules

The system uses die codes to represent a character's proficiency in certain areas, the effectiveness of
weapons, and the usefulness of equipment. These codes, represented by a number of six-sided dice, are 
used in rolling to determine success or failure in actions and mechanics within the game. The higher 
the die code, the better skilled or equipped the character is in that area. The core mechanics of the 
game revolves around these rolls.

## Dice Rolls

Skill rolls are determined by rolling a set of dice that includes a combination of attribute and skill dice. The number of dice in the pool depends on the attribute and skill ratings of the character, and the roll is modified by any relevant bonuses or penalties. The total of the roll will determine the success or failure of the action.

A dice pool is expressed as a combination of dice codes and pips. The dice code indicates the number of six-sided dice that are rolled when attempting an action, such as 1d, 2d, 3d, 4d, 5d, etc. Pips, represented by "+1" or "+2," are added to the total result of the dice roll.

## Difficulty Levels

Difficulty levels are used to determine the degree of difficulty of a task or action that a character attempts. The GM will determine the difficulty level of a task based on a variety of factors, such as the character's skill level, the complexity of the task, and any external factors that may affect the task.

There are generally a few different levels of difficulty used:

* Easy – Tasks that are easy to accomplish, with a low risk of failure, such as simple physical tasks, basic mathematical calculations, or other routine activities.

* Moderate – Tasks that require some skill or effort, but are still relatively straightforward, such as basic repair work, climbing a short wall, or simple lock-picking.

* Difficult – Tasks that are challenging and require a significant level of skill, effort, or experience to accomplish, such as complex repairs, open complex locks, or persuading a hostile adversary.

* Hard – Tasks that are extremely challenging and require a high level of skill, effort, or experience to accomplish, such as defusing a bomb, escaping from a maximum-security prison, or performing a complex surgery.

* Heroic – Tasks that are almost impossible to accomplish without extraordinary skill, effort, or experience, such as lifting a car, defying gravity, or performing a dangerous stunt.

| Difficulty  |  D    |  DC   |  TN   |  TX   | TY    | TZ    |
|:------------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Automatic   | 0     | 0     | 0     |  0    |  0    |   0   |
| Easy        | 2     | 1     | 5     |  4    |  3    |   3   |
| Moderate    | 4     | 2     | 10    |  8    |  6    |   5   |
| Difficult   | 6     | 3     | 15    |  12   |  9    |   8   |
| Hard        | 8     | 4     | 20    |  16   |  12   |   10  |
| Heroic      | 10    | 5     | 25    |  20   |  15   |   13  |
| Epic        | 12    | 6     | 30    |  24   |  18   |   15  |

## Advantage/Disadvantage Rolls.

When a dice pool is rolled at advantage or disadvantage the following steps are taken:

* If the roll is at advantage, any dice that show a result of 1 will be rolled again and ignored, then add the second roll.

* If the roll is at disadvantage, any dice that show a result of 6 will be rolled again and ignored, then add the second roll.

If multiple levels of advantage or disadvantage apply, they will cancel each other out until only one advantage, disadvantage, or none remains.

> For example, if a character has advantage and disadvantage on a roll at the same time. 
> The final roll will be made without any level of advantage or disadvantage.

## Target Number and Penalty Dice

To determine the final result of a roll, the following steps are taken:

* If there is a target number (TN), subtract it from the roll result to obtain the final result.

* If there are penalty dice, roll them and subtract the sum from the roll result to obtain the final result.

## Success Level

The success level is calculated by taking the final result of the roll and dividing it by 5, then rounding down.

## Taking the Average (ie. Defaulting)

Characters have the option to "default" on a dice roll if they have enough dice in their pool to automatically meet or exceed the target number (reference "TN" vs "D" columns) without rolling.

To be able to default on a roll, a character's dice pool must have at least the same number of dice as the TN and the penalty dice must be subtracted from the pool before defaulting can be considered. If a roll is made at disadvantage, defaulting is not possible, the character needs to roll the dice.

## Movement

The "Move" attribute represents a character's speed and mobility, and is used to determine how far 
they can move in a round of combat or how quickly they can cover distance. 

Each 1 point of Move represents 1 pace (or 5 feet) of non-combat movement when making a full move action.

Movement variations reflects different speeds of movement, or different ways in which a character can move.

* Creep – This is used for slow, stealthy movement, and is typically used for sneaking or crawling.

* Combat – This is used for quick and precise movements in combat, such as dodging or closing in on an enemy.

* Walk – This is the standard pace for most characters and is used for normal, non-combative movement.

* Brisk – This is a faster pace than walking, but not as fast as a run. 
It can be used for when a character needs to cover ground quickly without drawing attention to themselves.

* Jog – This is a moderate-speed run, used for covering moderate distances quickly.

* Run – This is used for covering long distances quickly, it can be used to outrun an enemy or 
to quickly reach a specific location.

* Sprint – This is used for short, fast bursts of movement, typically used for fleeing or chasing.

* Dash – This is used for very short and sudden bursts of movement, beyond even sprinting.
