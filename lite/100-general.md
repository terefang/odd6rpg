# General Rules

The system uses die codes to represent a character's proficiency in certain areas, the effectiveness of
weapons, and the usefulness of equipment. These codes, represented by a number of six-sided dice, are 
used in rolling to determine success or failure in actions and mechanics within the game. The higher 
the die code, the better skilled or equipped the character is in that area. The core mechanics of the 
game revolves around these rolls.

## Dice Rolls

Skill rolls are determined by rolling a set of dice that includes a combination of attribute and skill dice. The number of dice in the pool depends on the attribute and skill ratings of the character, and the roll is modified by any relevant bonuses or penalties. The total of the roll will determine the success or failure of the action.

A dice pool is expressed as a combination of dice codes and pips. The dice code indicates the number of six-sided dice that are rolled when attempting an action, such as 1d, 2d, 3d, 4d, 5d, etc. Pips, represented by "+1" or "+2," are added to the total result of the dice roll.

## Difficulty Levels

Difficulty levels are used to determine the degree of difficulty of a task or action that a character attempts. The GM will determine the difficulty level of a task based on a variety of factors, such as the character's skill level, the complexity of the task, and any external factors that may affect the task.

There are generally a few different levels of difficulty used:

* Trivial – Almost anyone should be able to do this most of the time.

* Easy – Most characters should be able to do this most of the time, with a low risk of failure, such as simple physical tasks, basic mathematical calculations, or other routine activities.

* Moderate – Tasks that require some skill or effort, but are still relatively straightforward, such as basic repair work, climbing a short wall, or simple lock-picking.

* Difficult – Tasks that are challenging and require a significant level of skill, effort, or experience to accomplish, such as complex repairs, open complex locks, or persuading a hostile adversary.

* Hard – Tasks that are extremely challenging and require a high level of skill, effort, or experience to accomplish, such as defusing a bomb, escaping from a maximum-security prison, or performing a complex surgery.

* Heroic – Tasks that are almost impossible to accomplish without extraordinary skill, effort, or experience, such as lifting a car, defying gravity, or performing a dangerous stunt.

* Epic – Tasks that are nearly impossible to accomplish, without incredible luck or aid of the powers that are.

| Difficulty  |  D/P  | DC/SL |  TN   |  TX   | TY    | TZ    |
|:------------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Automatic   | 0     | 0     | 0     |  0    |  0    |   0   |
| Trivial     | 1     | 1     | 5     |  4    |  3    |   3   |
| Easy        | 2     | 2     | 10    |  8    |  6    |   5   |
| Moderate    | 4     | 3     | 15    |  12   |  9    |   8   |
| Difficult   | 6     | 4     | 20    |  16   |  12   |   10  |
| Hard        | 8     | 5     | 25    |  20   |  15   |   13  |
| Heroic      | 10    | 6     | 30    |  24   |  18   |   15  |
| Epic        | 12    | 7     | 35    |  28   |  21   |   18  |

*   **D/P** — Dice Difficulty or average Penalty Dice to be applied.
*   **DC/SL** — Difficulty Class or Success Level.
*   **TN** — Main Target Number for checks.
*   **TX,TY,TZ** — Auxilliary Target Numbers.

## Advantage/Disadvantage Rolls

When a dice pool is rolled at advantage or disadvantage the following steps are taken:

* If the roll is at advantage, any dice that show a result of 1 will be rolled again and ignored, then add the second roll.

* If the roll is at disadvantage, any dice that show a result of 6 will be rolled again and ignored, then add the second roll.

If multiple levels of advantage or disadvantage apply, they will cancel each other out until only one advantage, disadvantage, or none remains.

## Expert Skill Rolls

Expert skills have a special rule called "exploding dice" which allows a player to roll again and add it to the previous roll if they roll the maximum value on the die. This can be repeated as long as maximum value is rolled.

When using expert skills, if a roll is made at Disadvantage, the dice still follow the exploding rule, but the initial 6 is discarded.

## Target Number and Penalty Dice

To determine the final result of a roll, the following steps are taken:

* If there is a target number (TN), subtract it from the roll result to obtain the final result.

* If there are penalty dice, roll them and subtract the sum from the roll result to obtain the final result.

## Success Level

The success level is calculated by comparing the final result of the roll against the appropriate column of the difficulty table.

## Critical Success

A roll of three sixes is used to indicate a critical success. When a roll results in three sixes, it usually means that the character has performed the action exceptionally well and will have a greater chance of success or gain a bonus.

A critical success can grant many benefits, such as extra damage on an attack, more favorable outcome on a skill check, or bonus on the next roll. It's at the discretion of the GM to decide what exactly the critical success will grant.

## Taking the Average (ie. Defaulting)

Characters have the option to "default" on a dice roll if they have enough dice in their pool to automatically meet or exceed the target number (reference "TN" vs "D" columns) without rolling.

To be able to default on a roll, a character's dice pool must have at least the same number of dice as the TN and the penalty dice must be subtracted from the pool before defaulting can be considered. If a roll is made at disadvantage, defaulting is not possible, the character needs to roll the dice.

## Improving Rolls

Characters have access to special points called Karma and Resources in addition to their attribute and skill scores. These points can be spent to gain an advantage or achieve success in particularly challenging or heroic situations.

### Resources

Resources can be spent to gain an advantage in task resolution by adding an extra die to the roll. These resources can also be spent after a roll has been made to attempt to improve the result.

### Karma Points

Karma can be spent by a character to focus their efforts on a specific task. This can only be done before any dice rolls are made and doubles the number of dice the character would normally roll for that round and action, allowing the character to perform that action to the best of their ability. 

The GM may permit more Karma to be spent in particularly challenging situations.
