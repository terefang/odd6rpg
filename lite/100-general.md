# General Rules

## Dice Rolls

Skill rolls are determined by rolling a set of dice that includes a combination of attribute and skill dice. The number of dice in the pool depends on the attribute and skill ratings of the character, and the roll is modified by any relevant bonuses or penalties. The total of the roll will determine the success or failure of the action.

Characters use a pool of dice that consist of the attribute die and skill die. The number of dice in this pool is determined by the character's attribute and skill ratings, and any bonuses or penalties that apply to the roll. The outcome of this roll will be the final result of the action's success or failure.

### Difficulty Levels

Difficulty levels are used to determine the degree of difficulty of a task or action that a character attempts. The GM will determine the difficulty level of a task based on a variety of factors, such as the character's skill level, the complexity of the task, and any external factors that may affect the task.

There are generally a few different levels of difficulty used:

* Easy – Tasks that are easy to accomplish, with a low risk of failure, such as simple physical tasks, basic mathematical calculations, or other routine activities.

* Moderate – Tasks that require some skill or effort, but are still relatively straightforward, such as basic repair work, climbing a short wall, or simple lock-picking.

* Difficult – Tasks that are challenging and require a significant level of skill, effort, or experience to accomplish, such as complex repairs, open complex locks, or persuading a hostile adversary.

* Hard – Tasks that are extremely challenging and require a high level of skill, effort, or experience to accomplish, such as defusing a bomb, escaping from a maximum-security prison, or performing a complex surgery.

* Heroic – Tasks that are almost impossible to accomplish without extraordinary skill, effort, or experience, such as lifting a car, defying gravity, or performing a dangerous stunt.

| Difficulty  | D    | DC   | TN   | TX   | TY   | TZ    |
|:------------|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-----:|
| Automatic   | 0     | 0     | 0     |  0    | 0    |  0   |
| Easy        | 2     | 1     | 5     |  4    | 3    |  3   |
| Moderate    | 4     | 2     | 10    |  8    | 6    |  5   |
| Difficult   | 6     | 3     | 15    |  12   | 9    |  8   |
| Hard        | 8     | 4     | 20    |  16   | 12   |  10  |
| Heroic      | 10    | 5     | 25    |  20   | 15   |  13  |
| Epic        | 12    | 6     | 30    |  24   | 18   |  15  |

### Advantage/Disadvantage Rolls.

* if the dice pool rolled is at Advantage, ignore any dice that come up as "1" and roll them again.

* if the dice pool rolled is at Disadvantage, ignore any dice that come up as "6" and roll them again.

Multiple levels of Advantage and Disadvantage cancel each other out, until only Advantage, Disadvantage or none remain.

### Target Number and Penalty Dice

* if there is a TN subtract it from the Roll Result to give the Final Result.

* if there are Penalty Dice roll them and subtract the sum from the Roll Result to give the Final Result.


### Success Level

The success level is established by dividing the Final Result by 5 rounded down.


### Taking the Average (ie. Defaulting)

A character can "default" on the dice roll (ie. not require to roll it), if she has at least the 
amount of dice correcponding to the Target Number (reference "TN" vs "D" columns).

Any penalty dice need to be subtracted from the dice pool before defaulting can be considered.

A character cannot "default" on the dice roll, if the roll is at Disadvantage.
