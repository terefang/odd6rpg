# Combat

## Rounds

A round is a unit of time, around 6 seconds, in which all participants in a battle take their turn. The order of turns is determined by the initiative roll made at the start of combat, and the combat continues to the next round until one side is victorious or retreats.

## Initiative 

Initiative is determined by rolling the initiative pool for each participant in combat, and adding any relevant bonuses or penalties. The participant with the highest roll goes first, followed by the participant with the next highest roll and so on.

During combat, players and adversaries take turns in order of their initiative roll. Each character can take a set of actions, such as movement, attacking, or spell casting.

The GM is responsible for keeping track of initiative order and any ties between participants. Some abilities may also affect a character's initiative roll, but the specifics of these cases are left to the GM's discretion.

## Combat Actions

The specific combat actions that are possible can vary depending on the GM's discretion and the actual situation at hand.

* Move – Characters can move around the area to position themselves better in combat.

* Attack – Characters can make physical attacks using a weapon, such as a sword or bow. The character will roll their combat skill and add any relevant bonuses or penalties to determine the success of the attack.

* Defend – Characters can take actions to defend themselves, such as using a shield or dodging, which can increase their defense against incoming attacks.

* Cast spell – Some characters may have access to spells and can cast them to attack or help allies in combat.

* Use special abilities – Some characters may have special abilities, such as spells or abilities that can be used in combat to gain an advantage.

* Use items – Characters can use consumable items such as potions or other objects that can affect the area or characters' status.

* Aiding Others – Characters can take actions to help their allies, such as healing or buffing.

* Ready – Characters may delay their actions until a specific event occurs within the round.

A player can choose to move and take one action, but they can also choose to do only one of those things or none at all. The order of moving and taking action is up to the player, but if they are uncertain of what to do, they can choose to take the Defend or Ready action as a default.

## Movement

The "Move" attribute represents a character's speed and mobility, and is used to determine how far 
they can move in a round of combat or how quickly they can cover distance. 

Each 1 point of Move represents 1 pace (or 5 feet) of non-combat movement when making a full move action.

Movement variations reflects different speeds of movement, or different ways in which a character can move.

* Creep – This is used for slow, stealthy movement, and is typically used for sneaking or crawling.

* Combat – This is used for quick and precise movements in combat, such as dodging or closing in on an enemy.

* Walk – This is the standard pace for most characters and is used for normal, non-combative movement.

* Brisk – This is a faster pace than walking, but not as fast as a run. 
It can be used for when a character needs to cover ground quickly without drawing attention to themselves.

* Jog – This is a moderate-speed run, used for covering moderate distances quickly.

* Run – This is used for covering long distances quickly, it can be used to outrun an enemy or 
to quickly reach a specific location.

* Sprint – This is used for short, fast bursts of movement, typically used for fleeing or chasing.

* Dash – This is used for very short and sudden bursts of movement, beyond even sprinting.

| Movement          | Speed | Typical Difficulty | In-Combat Difficulty |
|:------------------|:-----:|:---------------------|:---------------------|
|  Creep or Combat  | ×0.5  | Easy      | Moderate |
|  Walk             | ×1    | Automatic | Easy |
|  Brisk            | ×3/2  | Easy      | Moderate |
|  Jog              | ×2    | Moderate  | Difficult |
|  Run              | ×3    | Difficult | Hard |
|  Sprint           | ×4    | Hard      | Heroic |
|  Dash             | ×5    | Heroic    | Epic |

## Melee Attack

A melee attack is an attack made with a weapon that is used in close combat, typically hand-held weapons such as swords, axes, maces, spears, etc. A melee attack is made by rolling a dice pool made up of a character's relevant attribute (usually Strength or Dexterity) and skill (usually Blades, Axes, Bludgeons, etc.). The difficulty of an melee attack is usually moderate, taking into account the circumstances of the attack and the defense of the target as penalty dice.

If the roll is successful, the target takes damage based on the weapon's damage rating and the attacker's success level. A natural critical success will double damage.

## Attacking at Range

The difficulty of an attack can be affected by the distance or range to the target. For example, when making an attack roll, the difficulty of hitting a target at close range may be less than hitting a target at long range.

As the range to the target increases, the difficulty of hitting the target may increase. For example, hitting a target at point-blank range (very close) may be considered easy, hitting a target at close range may be considered moderate, hitting a target at medium range may be considered difficult, and hitting a target at long range may be considered very difficult or even heroic.

It's worth noting that the exact correlation between range and difficulty levels can vary depending on the GM's discretion and the specific setting. For example, In a fantasy setting with magic, a spell that allows ranged attack may have a longer range than a typical ranged weapon and the difficulty to hit a target may be different.

* Point-blank range – This is the range at which the target is very close to the attacker, often within melee weapon range. At this range, the difficulty of hitting the target is typically considered easy.

* Close range – This is the range at which the target is within short range of the attacker, often within the range of short-range weapons such as short swords or hand axes. At this range, the difficulty of hitting the target is typically considered moderate.

* Medium range – This is the range at which the target is within a moderate distance from the attacker, often within the range of medium-range weapons such as long swords or bows. At this range, the difficulty of hitting the target is typically considered difficult.

* Long range – This is the range at which the target is at a considerable distance from the attacker, often beyond the range of most melee weapons, but within the range of long-range weapons such as bows or crossbows. At this range, the difficulty of hitting the target is typically considered very difficult.

* Extreme range – This range is further away than long range and the difficulty to hit the target is considered heroic. This level of range is usually used for spells or other special abilities that can hit a target at far distances.

## Defending

When a character is attempting to defend against an attack, they can choose to use an active dice pool instead of relying on passive attributes such as Defense. This means that the character can use a skill roll to defend, such as using their Agility and Brawling skill to dodge an attack, or their Physique and Athletics skill to block it.

## Generic Weapons

Fantasy weapons are categorized based on their weight and the level of skill required to use them effectively. 
Here is a general description of fantasy weapons that would fall into the categories of light, medium, and heavy:

* Light weapons – These are typically small and easy to wield, such as daggers, short swords, and hand axes. 
They are typically fast, but don't deal as much damage as heavier weapons. Characters who are agile and fast, 
such as thieves or rogue, may prefer these weapons.

* Medium weapons – These are weapons that are larger and heavier than light weapons, but still relatively easy to wield, 
such as long swords, maces, and battle axes. They are a balance of speed and damage, and are popular among many different 
types of fantasy characters. Characters who are well-rounded, such as warriors and rangers, may prefer these weapons.

* Heavy weapons – These are large, heavy weapons that require significant strength and skill to wield effectively, 
such as great swords, war hammers, and halberds. They deal a lot of damage, but are slower to use. Characters who specialize 
in brute force, such as barbarians and paladins, may prefer these weapons.

| Category | Damage |
|:---------|:------:|
| Light    |   1d6  |
| Medium   |   2d6  |
| Heavy    |   3d6  |

## Generic Armor

When it comes to fantasy armor, it is categorized by the level of protection it offers and the amount of mobility it allows. Here is a revised explanation of fantasy armor that would fall under the categories of light, medium, and heavy:

* Light armor – Typically made of materials such as leather or padded cloth, these types of armor provide minimal protection from attacks. They prioritize speed and mobility, making them popular among characters that rely on agility to avoid attacks, such as thieves, rangers, and rogue characters. They offer less defense in exchange for more freedom of movement.

* Medium armor – Constructed from materials like chain mail or studded leather, medium armor provides moderate protection against attacks. They balance mobility and defense well, making them suitable for characters who depend on a mix of speed and durability, like warriors, fighters, paladins, etc. They are versatile and provide good balance between protection and freedom of movement.

* Heavy armor – Constructed from materials such as plate mail or full plate, heavy armor provides maximum protection from attacks. Although they prioritize defense over mobility, they are popular among characters who rely on brute strength and toughness to survive, such as barbarians and tanks. These types of armors offer the best defense but at the cost of reduced mobility, and usually require a significant amount of strength to wear.

| Category |  Armor |
|:---------|:------:|
| Light    |   1d6  |
| Medium   |   2d6  |
| Heavy    |   4d6  |
